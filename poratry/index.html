    <h3>family event ii (game night)</h3>
    <p>
      remove the game pieces from the box and give each player their player piece. set up the game board. put all of the player pieces in the nearest trash can, and shake the trash can (taking care to not let any trash escape). in turn order, search the trash can for your player piece, setting aside any pieces of trash you find. once all players have found their player piece, whoever has collected the most trash wins.

    <h3>
      family event iii (rocks)
    </h3>
    <p>
      find some people. hide in a tight circle while they throw rocks into a pot lid without purpose. one may pull you by the tail as another attempts to smash the pot lid over your head (watch out for the rocks). shriek performatively but not farcically, itâ€™s your moment.
